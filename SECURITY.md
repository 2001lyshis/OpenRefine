## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can report a vulnerability by opening a bug report [HERE](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/new/choose)

We will try our best to fix any valid vulnerability that is reported to us.

Keep in mind that OpenRefine is designed to run locally on a users PC, while also making network calls across the internet only upon a users choice or command.

As such, certain vulnerabilities might not apply to OpenRefine's design.
